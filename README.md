## Want to run this on your own machine?

### Requirements

To be able to run this program successfully, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- python3 (obviously)
- python3-venv
- python3-pip

Also you need to have an **OpenAI API Key**. If you don't have it, do this:

- Go [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup) to create an OpenAI account (if you already don't have an account).
- Go [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to generate a new API key.

*Remember to copy your generated API Key somewhere safe.*

### Installation Instructions

To install this program to your local system, follow these instructions.

# move into cloned directory
$ cd AACT

# run 'install.sh' file using:
$ ./install.sh
# or
$ bash install.sh
```

To be able to successfully make calls to the OpenAI API, you need to provide the program with your API key. To do so, copy this command to your terminal.

```
# replace 'example key' with your API key
$ echo "OPENAI_API_KEY='example key'" > ~/.AACT/.env
```

That should do it.
